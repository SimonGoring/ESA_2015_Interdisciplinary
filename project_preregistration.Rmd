Pre-registration: Patterns of interdisciplinarity in Ecology through ECOLOG
========================================================

This document acts as a pre-registration document for a project intended to highlight patterns of hiring in ecology based on publication in the ECOLOG mailing list.

The study aim to test whether:

1. The number of positions that invoke interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary or cross-disciplinary research are increasing in Ecology, as reflected by advertisments on the ECOLOG mailing list.

2. The number of interdisciplinary positions advertised is increasing faster for graduate students than it is for tenure track positions.
